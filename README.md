Lecture Notes for Lattices and Convex Bodies
============================================
These are the LaTeX source files to notes for a lecture with the title
"Lattices and Convex Bodies" given by me (Nicolai Hähnle) in the Fall of 2013.

The lecture will cover topics in the geometry of numbers from a decidedly
algorithmic perspective, and will focus more heavily on integer programming
later on.


Compilation, or: Where the hell is the PDF?
-------------------------------------------
I am not producing regularly updated PDF snapshots for public consumption.

That said, if you have a somewhat recent standard LaTeX installation (as you
should, if you are seriously interested in mathematics), simply running

$ pdflatex lattices

should do the trick.

You also need to run bibtex if you want to see the bibliography.

This is all very standard. If you do get compilation errors, drop me a line.
(But first make sure it's not just a missing package!)


Collaboration
-------------
If you notice any mistakes or find some way to improve the text or
illustrations, you are cordially invited to send your improvements to me
so that they can be incorporated -- with proper attribution, of course.

I prefer the use of Github features, but I'm also happy to receive an email
with a link to a public git repository hosted elsewhere, or a patch.

Among other things, this means that yes, you may take e.g. illustrations from
the book and use them in your own work. However, (a) you must give proper
